# Chatbot

This simple chatbot is implemented in C++ using the unordered_map data structure to store and retrieve information. It can respond to basic greetings, questions about its emotional state, and can remember and recall the user's name.

Features:

Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", and "hey".

Provides a generic response to questions about its emotional state.

Remembers and recalls the user's name.

Handles basic farewells like "bye", "see you later", and "later".

Usage:

Compile and run: Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).

Interact with the chatbot: Enter text input and receive responses from the console.

Example interactions:

User: hi
Bot: Hello user, how can I help you?
User: what's my name
Bot: Sorry you didn't tell me your name yet. Tell me your name
User: my name is Alice
Bot: Nice to meet you Alice

Customization:

Expand vocabulary: Add more keywords and responses to the if statements to enhance the chatbot's capabilities.

Implement more complex logic: Consider using more advanced techniques like natural language processing (NLP) to improve the chatbot's understanding and responses.

Integrate with external data: Connect the chatbot to external databases or APIs to access information and provide more relevant responses.

Note: This chatbot is a basic example and may have limitations in understanding complex queries or providing in-depth responses.
